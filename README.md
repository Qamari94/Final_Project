# Analyzing the Trends and Patterns of Digital Security Act (DSA) of Bangladesh and its Impact on Freedom of Expression

## Abstract
The purpose of this study is to use natural language processing to analyze the trends and patterns of Bangladesh's Digital Security Act (DSA) and how they affect the right to free speech. We believe that Bangladesh's freedom of expression has primarily suffered as a result of the DSA. To answer the research question: "What is the sentiment and main concerns associated with the DSA, as reflected in the analyzed articles, and how does it impact the freedom of speech in Bangladesh?" we analyze the content of various articles using Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), sentiment analysis, and word cloud visualizations. The findings reveal a largely unfavorable attitude toward the DSA, and the word cloud shows the most prevalent issues with the law. The study comes to the conclusion that the DSA has hurt Bangladesh's ability to express itself freely and may further damage democratic values.
